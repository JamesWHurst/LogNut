LogNut
======

This contains a set of client libraries for the LogNut logging system. LogNut's targeted platforms presently include .NET / C#, F#, C++, Python, and Swift. There are tentative plans to add direct support for JavaScript.

The work toward Release 1.0 is currently on implementing communication with the central server using Azure Service Bus and SignalR.

In the meantime..

LogNut can be used at this point on .NET on Windows, for a pure client implementation that does not require communication with any server.


Features/Advantages of LogNut:
* A simplified, well-documented API with C# examples to make this the easiest logging library to use
* File Output includes a comprehensive selection of output-field information that is fully configurable
* File Output may optionally be formatted for input into a spreadsheet
* Uniquely, when developing WPF desktop application, LogNut works well in design-time (as in Cider or Blend)
* Supports versions of Windows back to XP, with .NET Framework versions back to 3.5
