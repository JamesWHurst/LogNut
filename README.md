LogNut
======

LogNut is a logging library, together with a set of desktop-applications that serve as a reader and control-panel, and a server facility that comprises the LogNut logging system. LogNut's targeted platforms presently include Windows, Android, iOS and Linux. The programming-language support includes C#, F#, Java, and Swift. There are tentative plans to add direct support for JavaScript and C++.

The work toward Release 1.0 is currently on implementing communication with the central server using Azure Service Bus and SignalR.

In the meantime..

LogNut can be used at this point on Android, and on Windows.
